Project: Brick Breaker Game
-Classic Breakout/Brick Breaker style of game.

How to run it. 
1. Install Andriod Studio onto your device: https://developer.android.com/studio
2. Continue through all of the andriod studio installation steps (make sure to install Java). 
3. Clone this repository to the desired location on your local machine
   - Make sure to remember where it is cloned, so you can open the project in andriod studio
4. Click Open on andriod studio to open up the brickbreaker project
5. Find where you cloned this repository on your local machine (it should be called JavaApp)
6. Click on JavaApp (it should have an andriod logo next to it)
7. Allow for the files to index and for gradle to build... this may take awhile
8. Your SDK location file may not be correct, so go to File -> Project Structure.
   - If there was an error with the SDK location, opening this tab should show an alert and automatically fix it.
9. Once the project is done building, make sure you have created an emulation device. If you have not, click on Device manager and create one there. 
10. Finally, you should be able to see a green play button on the top of andriod studio, click it and the game should open.

Special Note: The emulator is very demanding, if you have a GPU, you should use it by doing the following:
1. Click Device Manager
2. Edit your emulation device
3. Under Verify Configuration, look for Emulated Performance
4. Change the selection to Hardware
